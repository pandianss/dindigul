COMPREHENSIVE BUILD PROMPTBank Regional Office PortalPublic-Facing & Internal Management SystemIndian Banking Context  •  200+ Staff  •  Multi-Branch / Outlet Coverage1. Project Overview & ObjectivesThis document is the complete build prompt for a dual-mode web portal serving a Bank Regional Office (RO) that oversees multiple branches and outlets with 200+ staff members operating within the Indian banking regulatory context. The system must be designed to be modular, scalable, and compliant with Indian banking data governance norms.1.1  High-Level GoalsCentralise all regional administrative, operational, and compliance workflows in a single platform.Enable real-time MIS visibility at the branch/outlet level derived from daily admin uploads.Automate generation of standard banking correspondence — appreciation letters, explanation letters, operational risk advisories, office notes, periodic returns, and campaign performance alerts.Provide a public-facing portal that derives live content from the internal system, presenting the Regional Office's brand, performance, and structure to external stakeholders.Maintain complete audit trails, posting histories, and user lifecycle records for regulatory and internal governance purposes.Publish an auto-generated Monthly Regional Magazine using the calendar of events.1.2  Technology RecommendationsThe following stack is recommended to ensure maintainability, security, and alignment with Indian IT Act compliance requirements:LayerRecommended TechnologyRationaleFrontendReact.js + Tailwind CSSComponent-driven, mobile-responsiveBackend APINode.js (Express) or Django REST FrameworkMature ecosystem, easy PDF/Excel generationDatabasePostgreSQLACID-compliant, strong for relational hierarchiesFile StorageAWS S3 / MinIO (on-prem)Secure document & media storageAuthOAuth2 / JWT with RBACRole-based access, session managementPDF GenerationPuppeteer or WeasyPrintLetter & report generationEmail/NotificationsSendGrid / SMTP + Firebase FCMAlerts, letter sharingBackground JobsCelery (Python) or Bull (Node)Scheduled MIS processing, magazine buildSearchElasticsearch or PostgreSQL full-textDocument, staff, event search2. User Roles & Access ControlThe system supports four primary user roles. Access is strictly role-based with granular permissions manageable by Admin. Every user is associated with a posting unit (Regional Office department or Branch/Outlet) and a designation, and the system maintains a full history of postings.2.1  Role DefinitionsRoleScopeKey CapabilitiesManaged ByAdminSystem-wideUser management, MIS upload, system configuration, audit logsSelf / Senior AdminRegional Office (RO) UserRegionalNotice board, letter generation, MIS, returns, dispatch, campaigns, magazine, committeesAdminBranch / Outlet UserSingle branch or outletView branch MIS, raise requests to RO, reply to RO queries, view noticesAdminGuest (Public)Public portal onlyRead-only access to org chart, contact directory, business summary, public events, achievementsN/A — unauthenticated2.2  User Profile Data ModelEach user record must capture the following fields:Full name, employee ID, designation, department/unitEmail, mobile number, office phone extensionRole assignment (Admin / RO User / Branch User)Current posting: unit name, unit type (Regional Office department / Branch / Outlet), date of joining current postPosting history: array of {unit, designation, from_date, to_date} records — never deletedProfile photo (used in org chart and contact directory)Active / Inactive status with reason and effective dateWhether user holds charge of a committee position or department head role (flag + effective dates)2.3  Admin: User ManagementCreate, edit, deactivate users — bulk import via CSV supportedAssign / reassign roles and posting unitsTransfer users between branches/RO departments — system automatically appends a new posting history record and closes the previous one with to_dateReset passwords and manage MFA settingsView full posting history for any userAudit log: all admin actions are logged with timestamp, actor, and change summary3. Admin Module3.1  Daily MIS UploadThe Admin uploads a consolidated MIS CSV file daily. The system processes this file and routes data to the appropriate branch/outlet views.Upload interface accepts CSV with configurable column mappingMandatory columns: Branch/Outlet Code, Date, and one or more business parameter columns (e.g., CASA balance, advances, NPA, collection efficiency, fee income, deposit growth, etc.)On upload: system validates data, flags errors row-by-row, and shows a preview before commitPost-commit: each Branch/Outlet User's MIS dashboard auto-refreshes with their own rows; RO Users see the full regional datasetUpload history log: date, file name, uploaded by, records processed, errorsDuplicate date detection: system warns if data for a date already exists and asks for overwrite confirmationAutomated variance detection: if a parameter for a branch/outlet exceeds configurable thresholds compared to previous day, previous week, or monthly average — flag is raised and triggers the Operational Risk Letter workflow (see Section 5.6)3.2  System ConfigurationManage branch/outlet master list: code, name, address, branch type (urban/semi-urban/rural/metro), IFSC, contactManage RO department master listConfigure MIS parameter thresholds for variance detectionConfigure campaign parameters and periodsManage document templates (appreciation letter, explanation letter, operational risk letter, office note templates)Configure periodic returns schedule (frequency, due dates, submission authority)Email/notification configuration4.

Public-Facing PortalThe public portal derives all its content from the internal system. It presents the Regional Office professionally to customers, stakeholders, and the public. No separate data entry is required for the public portal.6.1  Organisation Structure (Tree Chart)Dynamic org chart generated from internal user data — updates automatically when users are added, transferred, or deactivatedShows: Regional Office structure (departments and heads), then branches/outlets under the regionDisplays: name, designation, profile photo, department/unitClickable nodes: clicking a user card shows their public contact detailsResponsive and zoomable; mobile-friendly6.2  Contact DirectorySearchable directory of all staff whose details are marked as publicly visible by AdminFields shown: name, designation, department/unit, office phone, emailFilter by department, branch, or designation6.3  Business Summary of RegionHigh-level dashboard showing: total branches, total staff, key business highlights (formatted for public consumption)RO User controls which MIS parameters and values are surfaced publicly — Admin can configure thisUpdated automatically from MIS data on the configured refresh schedule6.4  Best Performing Branches for the MonthAuto-populated from internal campaign/MIS rankingsShows top N branches with parameter achieved — configurable by AdminRefreshed monthly6.5  Public Events & Photo GalleryEvents flagged as 'Public' in the internal Calendar of Events are shown hereEach event has: name, date, description, photo gallery (images uploaded internally)Gallery view with lightbox for photosUpcoming events section6.6  Region AchievementsGallery of awards, certificates, recognitions received by the Regional Office or its branchesEach entry: title, date received, issuing authority, photo/scan of certificate/awardManaged from the internal portal — RO User adds entries; they auto-publish to the public portal7. Posting History & Audit Infrastructure7.1  Posting HistoryEvery user has a posting history record: unit (RO department or Branch/Outlet), designation, from_date, to_date (null if current)When Admin reassigns a user, the system closes the current posting (sets to_date = today) and opens a new recordPosting history is immutable — records cannot be deleted, only corrected with Admin authorisation and an audit noteSystem reports: Who was posted where during a given period; Current composition of any unit; Historical composition of committees7.2  Audit LogsAll create / update / delete actions on any record are logged: user, timestamp, IP address, old values, new valuesAudit log is read-only and accessible only to AdminAudit log is never purged — export to Excel available for any date range7.3  Document Version HistoryAll generated documents (letters, returns, office notes, magazine) are versionedEach version: version number, generated by, generated at, status, file link8.
