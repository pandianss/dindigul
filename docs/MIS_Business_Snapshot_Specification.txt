MIS & BUSINESS SNAPSHOT MODULEDetailed Functional & Data SpecificationBank Regional Office Portal  •  Addendum to Build PromptIndian Banking Context  •  Working-Day Aware  •  Budget vs. Actuals  •  Multi-Period View1.  Module OverviewThe MIS module is re-specified as a Business Snapshot — a single, unified dashboard that places every key performance number in context across multiple time horizons simultaneously. Rather than a flat data dump, the Business Snapshot surfaces actuals, budgets, growth rates, gaps, and directional status for each business parameter in a structured, colour-coded layout that allows any user (from a branch clerk to the Regional Head) to understand performance at a glance without opening a spreadsheet.The module is working-day aware: all growth rates, annualisation projections, and pace indicators are calculated against working days elapsed and remaining, using a calendar maintained by the Admin where bank holidays and non-working days are explicitly marked.1.1  Design PrinciplesSingle source of truth — all figures derive from the daily CSV uploaded by Admin; no manual entry on the snapshot screen.Context over data — every actual is shown alongside its budget, gap, growth, and a status indicator so that the number is never shown in isolation.Working-day precision — growth rates and pace calculations use actual elapsed working days, not calendar days, reflecting Indian banking realities (RBI holidays, state-specific holidays, regional bank-specific off days).Multi-period — the snapshot covers previous FY, current FY, current quarter, current month, and last 1 working day in a single view.Role-filtered — Branch/Outlet Users see only their own branch data; RO Users see any branch or the full region; both views use the same layout.Exportable — the snapshot can be downloaded as a formatted PDF or Excel at any time.2.  Holiday & Working Day Calendar (Admin-Managed)All working-day calculations across the portal — MIS growth rates, pace indicators, periodic return due dates, and campaign milestones — depend on an authoritative calendar managed exclusively by Admin. This calendar is the foundation of the entire Business Snapshot.2.1  Calendar AdministrationAdmin accesses a dedicated Calendar Management screen under System Configuration.Admin marks individual dates as one of the following types:Working Day (default — all weekdays start as working days)Public Holiday (national holidays under NI Act — Republic Day, Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti, etc.)RBI Holiday (as notified by RBI each year)State Holiday (state-specific holidays relevant to the region's geography)Bank-Specific Holiday (internal closures, local festivals observed by the bank)Half Day (counts as 0.5 working day in all calculations)Saturdays: Admin marks which Saturdays are working (2nd and 4th Saturdays off as per Indian banking norm is the default, but Admin can override any Saturday individually).Sundays are always non-working and cannot be overridden.Admin can bulk-import the RBI holiday list for the year via CSV upload.Changes to the calendar retroactively recalculate all snapshot figures for the affected period — the system queues a background recalculation job and notifies Admin when complete.Calendar is published read-only to all portal users so they can view upcoming holidays.Calendar must be set up for at least the current financial year before the MIS module can be used; system warns Admin if the calendar has gaps.2.2  Working Day Calculation LogicThe following definitions apply uniformly throughout the snapshot calculations:TermDefinitionWorking Days Elapsed (WDE) — FYCount of working days from 1 April of the current FY up to and including the current snapshot dateTotal Working Days (TWD) — FYCount of all working days in the full current financial year (1 April to 31 March)Working Days Remaining (WDR) — FYTWD(FY) minus WDE(FY)WDE — Current MonthCount of working days from 1st of current month to current snapshot dateTWD — Current MonthTotal working days in the current calendar monthWDE — Current QuarterCount of working days from start of current quarter to current snapshot dateTWD — Current QuarterTotal working days in the current financial quarter (Q1: Apr–Jun, Q2: Jul–Sep, Q3: Oct–Dec, Q4: Jan–Mar)Working Day Pace (%)WDE ÷ TWD × 100 — the proportion of the period that has elapsed in working-day terms. Used to determine whether a branch is ahead of or behind pace.Previous Working Day (PWD)The most recent working day before the current snapshot date, per the Admin calendar3.  Business ParametersThe Business Snapshot is parameter-driven. Admin configures the list of parameters in System Configuration. The table below shows the recommended default parameter set for a commercial bank Regional Office in the Indian context. All parameters can be activated, deactivated, or reordered by Admin without a code change.3.1  Default Parameter Library#Parameter NameUnitCategoryNotes1Total Deposits₹ CroreLiabilitiesCASA + Term Deposits2CASA Deposits₹ CroreLiabilitiesCurrent + Savings balances3CASA Ratio%LiabilitiesCASA ÷ Total Deposits4Current Account Deposits₹ CroreLiabilities5Savings Account Deposits₹ CroreLiabilities6Term Deposits₹ CroreLiabilitiesFD + RD7Total Advances₹ CroreAssetsGross advances8Retail Advances₹ CroreAssets9MSME Advances₹ CroreAssets10Agriculture Advances₹ CroreAssetsPriority Sector11Home Loan Portfolio₹ CroreAssets12Vehicle Loan Portfolio₹ CroreAssets13Gold Loan Portfolio₹ CroreAssets14Gross NPA₹ CroreAsset Quality15Gross NPA Ratio%Asset QualityGross NPA ÷ Gross Advances16Net NPA₹ CroreAsset Quality17Net NPA Ratio%Asset Quality18SMA-0 + SMA-1 + SMA-2₹ CroreAsset QualityEarly warning19Recovery & Upgradation₹ CroreAsset QualityMonth / FY20Fee Income₹ LakhIncomeNon-interest income21Interest Income₹ CroreIncome22Net Interest Margin (NIM)%Income23Operating Profit₹ CroreIncome24New Account Openings — CASACountAcquisition25New Account Openings — TermCountAcquisition26New Loan Accounts SanctionedCountAcquisition27Loan Disbursements₹ CroreAssets28Digital TransactionsCountDigitalUPI + IMPS + NEFT + RTGS29Mobile Banking Active UsersCountDigital30Insurance Premium Mobilised₹ LakhCross-sellLife + Non-life31Mutual Fund AUM₹ LakhCross-sell32Collection Efficiency%Asset QualityEMI collected ÷ EMI due33Number of Working AccountsCountBusinessAccounts with ≥1 txn in last 6 months34Staff Productivity (Advances)₹ CroreEfficiencyTotal Advances ÷ Total Staff35Staff Productivity (Deposits)₹ CroreEfficiencyTotal Deposits ÷ Total StaffAdmin can add custom parameters not listed above — define name, unit, category, and whether lower values are better (e.g. NPA, Gross NPA Ratio — for these, 'Positive' status means the actual is below budget/previous, not above).Admin sets the 'lower is better' flag per parameter; this controls the colour coding and status logic throughout the snapshot.4.  Business Snapshot — Column DefinitionsThe Business Snapshot presents each parameter as a single row. The columns across that row provide the full multi-period picture. All columns are described below in the order they appear left-to-right in the on-screen and exported view.4.1  Complete Column SpecificationColumn Group A — Parameter IdentificationColColumn NameTypeDescriptionA1Parameter NameTextName of the business parameter (e.g. 'Total Deposits', 'Gross NPA Ratio')A2UnitTextDisplay unit — ₹ Crore, ₹ Lakh, %, Count, etc.A3CategoryTextLiabilities / Assets / Asset Quality / Income / Acquisition / Digital / Cross-sell / Efficiency — used for grouping rows in the displayColumn Group B — Previous Financial YearFinancial Year runs 1 April to 31 March as per Indian standard.ColColumn NameSource / CalcDescriptionB1Prev FY Opening (1 Apr)MIS DataActual balance / value as at 1 April of the previous financial year (i.e., opening of PFY).

Status Logic & Colour CodingEach period group (Prev FY, Current FY, Current Month, Current Quarter) carries a Status column. Status is determined by the pace indicator for that period. The colour scheme provides immediate visual feedback at a glance.5.1  Standard Parameters (Higher is Better — e.g., Deposits, Advances, Fee Income)ConditionStatus LabelColourMeaningActual ≥ Full Period BudgetSURPASSEDDark GreenBudget fully achieved and exceeded before the period end.Pace Indicator ≥ 0% (on or ahead of pace)POSITIVEBlueAhead of working-day pace; on track to achieve the budget.Pace Indicator between −10% and 0%LAGGINGAmberSlightly behind pace — within recovery range. Triggers watch-list flag.Pace Indicator < −10%NEGATIVERedSignificantly behind pace; intervention required. Triggers explanation letter eligibility.5.2  Inverse Parameters (Lower is Better — e.g., Gross NPA, NPA Ratio, SMA)For parameters flagged as 'lower is better' in Admin configuration, the status logic is inverted:ConditionStatus LabelColourMeaningActual ≤ Budget (achieved better than target)SURPASSEDDark GreenNPA / negative parameter is below the budget threshold — excellent.Actual is within 10% above budgetPOSITIVEBlueSlightly above budget but within acceptable range.Actual is 10%–20% above budgetLAGGINGAmberNPA / negative parameter deteriorating — watch.Actual > 20% above budgetNEGATIVERedSignificant deterioration — immediate action / reporting required.5.3  Threshold ConfigurationThe −10% and −20% pace thresholds (for the LAGGING / NEGATIVE boundary) are configurable by Admin per parameter.Different parameters may have different sensitivity — e.g., NPA Ratio may have tighter thresholds (−5%) than Deposit growth (−10%).Admin can also configure a 'critical' flag for certain parameters (e.g. Gross NPA Ratio) that sends an immediate in-app alert to the RO Risk department whenever the status moves to NEGATIVE.6.  Budget Upload & ManagementBudgets are uploaded separately from daily MIS data. The budget defines the targets against which all gap and status calculations are made.6.1  Budget Types RequiredBudget TypeGranularityDescriptionAnnual FY BudgetBranch × ParameterFull-year target for each parameter for each branch/outlet. Uploaded once at the start of the financial year (April). Used for C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12 calculations.Monthly BudgetBranch × Parameter × MonthMonthly increment or absolute closing target per branch. Uploaded monthly (or all 12 months at once at FY start). Used for D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9 calculations.Quarterly End BudgetBranch × Parameter × QuarterAbsolute closing balance target at each quarter end (30 Jun, 30 Sep, 31 Dec, 31 Mar). Used for E4, E5, E6, E7, E8 calculations.Previous FY BudgetBranch × ParameterUploaded once for the just-closed FY. Used for B5, B6, B7, B8 calculations.6.2  Budget CSV Upload FormatFile: CSV with columns — Branch_Code, Parameter_Code, Period_Type (Annual / Monthly / Quarterly), Period (e.g. FY2526 / Apr-25 / Q1FY26), Budget_ValueSystem validates: all active branches must have a budget row for each active parameter; missing rows are flagged as warnings (not errors) and treated as zero budgetBudget can be revised mid-year: upload a revised file; system stores both original and revised budget with effective dates and shows which version is activeBudget revision history is auditable — who revised, when, original vs. revised values6.3  Budget vs. MIS ReconciliationIf a parameter exists in MIS but has no corresponding budget row, it is shown in the snapshot with N/A in all budget and gap columns — no status badge is shownIf a budget row exists for a parameter but no MIS data has been uploaded for that period, the MIS value shows as 'Pending' and status shows as 'No Data'Admin dashboard shows a reconciliation status — count of parameters with budget, MIS, both, or neither — per branch per period7.

Downstream Integrations from Business SnapshotThe Business Snapshot is not a standalone view — it drives multiple other portal functions automatically.Downstream ModuleHow Snapshot Data Is UsedOperational Risk LettersWhen status changes to NEGATIVE for parameters configured as 'critical', or when 1-day change (F3) exceeds the variance threshold in absolute or percentage terms, a draft Operational Risk Letter is auto-created for RO User review and sharing with the branch.Campaign Performance TrackerThe snapshot's current actual (C2) and monthly growth (D2) feed the campaign performance dashboard. Campaign pace is calculated using the same working-day denominator logic.Appreciation & Explanation LettersAt month-end / FY-end, branches ranked by C11 (budget achievement %) or D8 (monthly achievement %). Top N → appreciation trigger. Bottom N or below threshold → explanation trigger.Periodic ReturnsMany periodic returns to Central/Zonal Office require figures that exist in the snapshot (Deposit totals, Advance totals, NPA ratios). These are auto-populated from the snapshot data for the relevant reporting date.Monthly MagazineThe magazine's 'Business Highlights' section auto-populates from the month-end snapshot: best growth parameters, best-performing branches (by D8 and C11), and the region's overall YTD status.Public Portal — Business SummaryRO User selects which parameters (and which display values — typically C2 in ₹ Crore and C6 as growth %) to surface on the public-facing Business Summary widget. No confidential budget or gap data is ever published publicly.Branch ScorecardAuto-computed scorecard pulls C13 and D10 status per parameter per branch, assigns points, and ranks branches. Feeds 'Best Performing Branches' on the public portal.End of MIS / Business Snapshot SpecificationThis document fully replaces Section 3.1 (Daily MIS Upload) of the main Bank Regional Office Portal Build Prompt, and expands the MIS concept into a comprehensive, working-day-aware Business Snapshot. All column codes (B1–F4), status logic, budget types, calendar management, and downstream integrations described herein should be read together with the main Build Prompt. Implement the holiday calendar module before the MIS upload module, as the former is a prerequisite of the latter.
