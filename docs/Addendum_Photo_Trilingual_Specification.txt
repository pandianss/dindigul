ADDENDUMUser Portrait Photos  &  Trilingual Portal SpecificationEnglish  •  தமிழ்  •  हिन्दीSupplement to Bank Regional Office Portal Build Prompt  •  Indian Banking Context1.  Scope of This AddendumThis addendum supplements the Bank Regional Office Portal Build Prompt and the MIS / Business Snapshot Specification with two cross-cutting requirements that affect every module, every user-facing screen, and every generated document in the portal:Portrait Photo — every user record must carry a standardised portrait photograph that appears consistently across the org chart, contact directory, user profile pages, generated letters, staff ID elements, and the public portal.Trilingual Interface — the entire portal (UI labels, navigation, notices, generated documents, public portal content, notifications, and system messages) must be available in three languages: English, Tamil (தமிழ்), and Hindi (हिन्दी). Users select their preferred language; the system remembers the choice. Document generation produces output in whichever language the generating user selects.Both requirements must be treated as first-class architectural concerns — not cosmetic additions. They must be designed into the data model, the document generation pipeline, the content management system, and the frontend rendering layer from day one.2.  User Portrait Photo — Full Specification2.1  Photo RequirementsPortrait photos serve formal purposes — appearing on official correspondence, the public-facing org chart, and staff registers. Standards must be enforced at upload time.AttributeRequirementFormatJPEG or PNG only. System converts PNG to JPEG on storage.Minimum Resolution400 × 500 pixels (portrait orientation, 4:5 ratio). System rejects images below this.Maximum File Size5 MB at upload. System compresses to ≤ 200 KB for storage (lossless quality at 90%); original is retained separately for print-quality use.Aspect Ratio4:5 (portrait). System auto-crops to this ratio with a centre-face crop guide shown to the uploader. Manual crop adjustment supported before save.BackgroundGuidance shown to uploader: plain light background preferred (white or light grey). System does not enforce this but shows a quality hint.Face VisibilityThe system uses a lightweight client-side face-detection check (e.g., face-api.js) to warn the uploader if no face is detected. Upload is not blocked — it is a soft warning.Colour vs. B&WColour photos only. The document generation pipeline converts to greyscale automatically for formal letters if the Admin template specifies greyscale.Versions StoredThree sizes generated on upload: Thumbnail (80×100 px) for lists and tables; Standard (240×300 px) for profile cards, org chart, and document headers; High-res (original, up to 800×1000 px) for print-quality PDF generation.MandatoryYes — Admin cannot activate a user account without a photo. A default placeholder (silhouette) is shown for accounts in 'Pending Photo' state. The system shows a banner reminder to the user on every login until they upload a photo.2.2  Photo Upload FlowAdmin creates a user record — photo upload is the final step before account activation.Admin can upload on behalf of the user (e.g., from a scanned ID photo), or send the user a one-time photo upload link via email that allows them to upload only their own photo without full login.User can update their own photo at any time from their profile settings — subject to Admin approval before the new photo replaces the current one on official documents and the public portal.Photo update history is maintained: date changed, uploaded by, approved by — previous photos are never deleted (stored in archive).Bulk photo upload supported: Admin uploads a ZIP file containing photos named by Employee ID (e.g., EMP001.jpg); system matches and assigns automatically, flagging mismatches.2.3  Where Portrait Photos AppearLocationSize Used / BehaviourUser Profile Page (Internal Portal)Standard (240×300). Displayed prominently at top of profile.Organisation Chart (Internal & Public)Thumbnail (80×100). Circular crop applied via CSS. Clicking opens standard size in a tooltip.Contact Directory (Internal & Public)Thumbnail (80×100). Circular crop in card layout.Notice Board — Posted ByThumbnail. Small avatar shown next to poster's name and designation.Request Thread (Branch ↔ RO)Thumbnail. Avatar shown next to each message in the thread, mirroring a chat interface.Committee Register — Members ListThumbnail. Grid layout showing all committee members with photo, name, designation.Generated Letters (Appreciation, Explanation, Office Notes)Standard size. Signatory's photo printed in the signature block of generated PDFs, alongside name and designation. Greyscale conversion applied for formal letters.Monthly MagazineStandard size. Author photo used in the 'Message from Regional Head' section. Staff announcements (new joiners, transfers) include thumbnail photos.Staff ID / Visiting Card Generator (suggested enhancement)High-res. Used for ID card layout and visiting card PDF generation.Posting History RecordThumbnail. The photo current at the time of a posting record is stored with the record, so historical posts show the photo from that period.2.4  Storage & Access ControlPhotos are stored in a dedicated secure object store (S3 bucket or equivalent) with no public read access.All photo URLs are signed, time-limited (15-minute expiry) — never direct public file paths.The public portal fetches thumbnails and standard-size photos for the org chart and contact directory via a backend proxy that strips metadata (EXIF) before serving.High-res photos are accessible only to the document generation service and Admin — never served directly to front-end clients.Photos are included in the system backup schedule with the same retention policy as all user data.3.  Trilingual Architecture — OverviewThe portal must support three languages with equal standing: English (en), Tamil (ta — தமிழ்), and Hindi (hi — हिन्दी). This is not a superficial translation layer — the three languages serve distinct user communities across the Regional Office and its branches, reflecting the sociolinguistic reality of South Indian banking.3.1  Language Hierarchy & DefaultsContextDefault Language BehaviourInternal Portal — Authenticated UserUser's preferred language (set in profile, default = English). Language preference is saved per user and applied on every login.Public PortalDefault = English. Prominent language switcher (EN | தமிழ் | हि) in the page header. Browser locale is detected and used as initial default if it matches one of the three languages.Generated Documents (Letters, Returns, Notes, Magazine)Language is selected by the RO User at document generation time. The system remembers the last-used language per document type per user. Any document can be generated in all three languages simultaneously (produces three separate PDFs).Notifications (In-app & Email)Sent in the recipient user's preferred language. System-generated alerts (e.g., MIS variance alerts) are sent trilingual if the recipient's language preference is not set.Admin InterfaceEnglish only for system configuration screens (parameter names, template management, holiday calendar). All end-user-facing content management screens support all three languages.3.2  i18n Technical ArchitectureFrontend: implement using a standard i18n library — React i18next (recommended for React.js stack). All UI strings externalised into JSON translation files: en.json, ta.json, hi.json.Language files are structured by module namespace to avoid conflicts and enable lazy loading (e.g., mis.en.json, noticeboard.ta.json).Font strategy:English: Arial / Inter (system default)Tamil: Noto Sans Tamil — embed as web font. Required for correct rendering of Tamil script, especially conjunct characters.Hindi: Noto Sans Devanagari — embed as web font. Required for correct Devanagari rendering.All three fonts must be embedded in generated PDFs (WeasyPrint / Puppeteer font configuration).Text direction: all three languages are left-to-right (LTR) — no RTL handling required.Number formatting: Indian number system (lakhs/crores) with locale-appropriate digit grouping applies in all three languages. Currency symbol ₹ is universal.Date formatting:English: DD Month YYYY (e.g., 18 August 2025)Tamil: DD மாதம் YYYY (month name in Tamil)Hindi: DD माह YYYY (month name in Hindi)Backend: all content stored in the database with a language code field — one row per language variant for user-generated content (notice text, event descriptions, campaign names, document narrative sections).API responses include the requested language via Accept-Language header or explicit lang query parameter.3.3  Translation ManagementA Translation Management screen is available to Admin and designated RO Users (Translation Editors role).All static UI strings are version-controlled in the codebase (JSON files) and managed by the development team. Updates require a deployment.All dynamic / user-generated content (notice text, document templates, event descriptions, magazine sections, campaign names, parameter names displayed in UI) must be entered in all three languages when created. The system enforces this with a tabbed input form:Three tabs: English | தமிழ் | हिन्दी — each tab has the same input fields.Minimum requirement: English content is mandatory. Tamil and Hindi can be left blank — system falls back to English for missing translations (showing a 'Translation pending' badge to Admin).A machine translation assist button (calls a translation API such as Google Translate or IndicTrans2 — an open-source Indian language model) pre-fills Tamil and Hindi tabs from English input. Human review and edit is expected before saving.Translation completeness dashboard: shows % of dynamic content translated per module per language. Admin can filter to 'untranslated' items and bulk-assign translation tasks to Translation Editors.4.  Trilingual Content — Module-by-Module Specification4.1  User Interface (All Screens)Every navigation label, button, form field label, table header, tooltip, error message, success message, and system alert must exist in all three languages in the i18n JSON files.Language toggle: persistent toggle in the top navigation bar, visible on every screen.Switching language takes effect instantly (no page reload) — React i18next handles this client-side.The current language selection is persisted in the user's session and profile.4.2  Notice BoardWhen creating a notice, the RO User fills three language tabs (English, Tamil, Hindi) for: Title, Body text, any attachments' display name.A branch user whose preferred language is Tamil sees the Tamil version of the notice if it exists; falls back to English if Tamil has not been entered.The Acknowledgement button text and confirmation message appear in the reader's preferred language.Notice PDF download (for archival) is generated in the language selected at download time — or all three as a trilingual document with language sections stacked.4.3  Generated Letters & DocumentsAll generated documents must support trilingual output. The following applies to Appreciation Letters, Explanation Letters, Operational Risk Letters, Office Notes, Periodic Returns, Campaign Performance Letters, and the Monthly Magazine.4.3.1  Document Template ArchitectureEvery document type has three template versions stored in the system: one per language.Templates use the same merge field codes ({branch_name}, {parameter}, {value}, etc.) regardless of language — the merge engine substitutes language-appropriate values.Merge field values that come from the database (e.g., branch names, parameter names, designation titles) must themselves have translations — stored as translatable master data (see Section 4.7).Template management UI: Admin opens any template and sees three side-by-side edit panes (EN | TA | HI), with the English version on the left as reference while editing Tamil and Hindi.Font embedding: PDF generation pipeline embeds Noto Sans Tamil, Noto Sans Devanagari, and Arial for all generated PDFs — ensuring correct rendering even when opened on systems without these fonts installed.4.3.2  Generating a Trilingual DocumentRO User selects language at generation time: English | Tamil | Hindi | All Three.'All Three' option produces a single PDF with three sections — one per language — separated by a language header page. Useful for formal communications that must be understood by all recipients.Letterhead, logo, and bank name appear in each section with the appropriate script.Signatory block: name and designation appear in the chosen language. The signatory's portrait photo appears once (language-neutral).Document metadata (filename, document number, date) always includes the language code as a suffix: e.g., APPR-2025-08-BR01-EN.pdf / APPR-2025-08-BR01-TA.pdf / APPR-2025-08-BR01-HI.pdf4.4  Monthly MagazineThe magazine is published in three separate editions — English, Tamil, Hindi — each with its own cover, masthead, and section headers in the respective language.The 'Message from the Regional Head' section: the Regional Head (or their secretary) inputs the message text in all three languages using the three-tab input. Machine translation assist is available.Auto-populated sections (event summaries, MIS highlights, staff movements) pull from trilingual database fields — if a Tamil or Hindi version is not available for a specific item, the English version is used with a small '(English)' note.Magazine PDF: three separate files generated and stored. All three are available for download from the internal portal. The public portal publishes the English edition by default; users can switch to Tamil or Hindi.4.5  Public PortalLanguage toggle (EN | தமிழ் | हि) is prominently placed in the page header — visible immediately on load.Organisation structure tree chart: user names, designations, and department names are displayed in the selected language.Contact directory: designation and department labels switch language; names remain in English (as per bank official records).Business summary widget: parameter labels and status text appear in the selected language; numeric values are language-neutral.Events section: event titles and descriptions switch to the selected language (if translated).Achievements section: award titles and descriptions switch language.Best Performing Branches: branch names remain in English; supporting text switches language.All static page content (About the Region, navigation labels, footer) must be translated in full.4.6  Email & In-App NotificationsSystem reads the recipient's preferred language from their user profile.Email notifications: subject line and body are rendered in the recipient's preferred language.Email footer always includes: 'This message is available in English, தமிழ், and हिन्दी. To change your language preference, update your profile.' (shown in all three languages).In-app notifications: text in user's preferred language. A small flag icon (🇮🇳 EN / TA / HI) indicates the language of the notification.For broadcast notifications (sent to all users regardless of language preference), the system sends a single notification containing all three language versions stacked — the user reads in their preferred language.4.7  Translatable Master DataThe following master data entities must store a language label for each of the three languages. Admin manages these translations in System Configuration.Master Data EntityExample (English)Translation Fields RequiredDepartment NamesCredit Departmentname_en, name_ta, name_hiDesignation TitlesBranch Managerdesignation_en, designation_ta, designation_hiBranch / Outlet NamesAnna Nagar Branchname_en, name_ta, name_hi (official translated name)MIS Parameter NamesTotal Depositslabel_en, label_ta, label_hiMIS Parameter CategoriesAsset Qualitylabel_en, label_ta, label_hiRequest CategoriesGL Head Activationlabel_en, label_ta, label_hiDocument TypesAppreciation Letterlabel_en, label_ta, label_hiCommittee NamesCustomer Service Committeename_en, name_ta, name_hiEvent TypesTraining Programmelabel_en, label_ta, label_hiStatus LabelsPOSITIVE / NEGATIVE / SURPASSEDstatus_en, status_ta, status_hi — used in MIS snapshot badgesMonth NamesApril, May, …Hardcoded in i18n JSON files — 12 entries per languageQuarter LabelsQ1 (Apr–Jun)Hardcoded in i18n JSON files — 4 entries per language5.  Reference Translation Table — Key UI StringsThe following table provides a reference set of critical UI strings in all three languages. This should be used as the seed vocabulary for the i18n JSON files and for briefing the translation team. All strings were validated for the Indian banking context.English (en)தமிழ் (ta)हिन्दी (hi)CategoryNavigation & Core UIDashboardகட்டுப்பாட்டுப் பலகைडैशबोर्डNavNotice Boardஅறிவிப்பு பலகைसूचना पट्टNavMIS / Business Snapshotவணிக நிலைப்படம்व्यापार स्नैपशॉटNavRequestsகோரிக்கைகள்अनुरोधNavCalendar of Eventsநிகழ்வு நாட்காட்டிकार्यक्रम कैलेंडरNavDispatch Registerஅனுப்புகை பதிவேடுप्रेषण रजिस्टरNavCommitteesகுழுக்கள்समितियाँNavMonthly Magazineமாதாந்திர பத்திரிகைमासिक पत्रिकाNavSettingsஅமைப்புகள்सेटिंग्सNavLogoutவெளியேறுलॉगआउटNavMIS / Business SnapshotTotal Depositsமொத்த வைப்புகள்कुल जमाराशिMISTotal Advancesமொத்த கடன்கள்कुल ऋणMISGross NPAமொத்த NPAसकल एनपीएMISCASA RatioCASA விகிதம்CASA अनुपातMISFee Incomeகட்டண வருமானம்शुल्क आयMISCurrent Actualதற்போதைய இருப்புवर्तमान वास्तविकMISPrevious Working Dayமுந்தைய பணி நாள்पिछला कार्य दिवसMISBudgetபட்ஜெட்बजटMISGap to Budgetபட்ஜெட் இடைவெளிबजट अंतरMISPace Indicatorவேக குறிகாட்டிगति संकेतकMISSURPASSEDமிகைப்படுத்தப்பட்டதுलक्ष्य से अधिकStatusPOSITIVEநேர்மறைसकारात्मकStatusLAGGINGபின்தங்கியுள்ளதுपिछड़ रहा हैStatusNEGATIVEஎதிர்மறைनकारात्मकStatusLetters & CorrespondenceAppreciation Letterபாராட்டு கடிதம்प्रशंसा पत्रLettersExplanation Letterவிளக்கக் கடிதம்स्पष्टीकरण पत्रLettersOperational Risk Letterசெயல்பாட்டு அபாய கடிதம்परिचालन जोखिम पत्रLettersTo Whomsoever It May Concernசம்பந்தப்பட்டோருக்குसंबंधित कोLettersRegional Managerபிராந்திய மேலாளர்क्षेत्रीय प्रबंधकLettersBranch Managerகிளை மேலாளர்शाखा प्रबंधकLettersWith reference to the aboveமேற்கண்டது தொடர்பாகउपर्युक्त के संदर्भ मेंLettersYou are hereby advisedஇதன்மூலம் அறிவிக்கப்படுகிறீர்கள்आपको एतद्द्वारा सूचित किया जाता हैLettersYours faithfullyஉங்கள் உண்மையுள்ளभवदीयLetters6.

NOT NULL.title_ta / body_taTEXT NULLABLETamil version — OPTIONAL. NULL triggers English fallback in the UI.title_hi / body_hiTEXT NULLABLEHindi version — OPTIONAL. NULL triggers English fallback in the UI.translation_statusJSONB{ ta: 'complete'|'pending'|'machine', hi: 'complete'|'pending'|'machine' } — tracks translation state per language. 'machine' = auto-translated, awaiting human review.7.  Font & PDF Generation Pipeline7.1  Required FontsFontLanguageUsage & NotesArial / InterEnglishUI body text, table content, letter bodies in English. Inter preferred for screen; Arial for PDF embedding.Noto Sans TamilTamil (தமிழ்)All Tamil script rendering — UI, letters, magazine. Download from Google Fonts. Must be subset-embedded in all PDFs containing Tamil text.Noto Sans DevanagariHindi (हिन्दी)All Devanagari script rendering. Download from Google Fonts. Must be subset-embedded in all PDFs containing Hindi text.Noto Serif TamilTamil — formal docsOptional: use Noto Serif Tamil for formal letter bodies in Tamil for a more traditional look.Noto Serif DevanagariHindi — formal docsOptional: use Noto Serif Devanagari for formal letter bodies in Hindi.7.2  PDF Generation RequirementsUse WeasyPrint (Python) or Puppeteer (Node.js) for PDF generation — both support Unicode and custom font embedding.All PDFs must declare UTF-8 encoding in the HTML/CSS template source.Font files (Noto Sans Tamil, Noto Sans Devanagari, Arial) must be placed in the PDF generation service's font directory and referenced by absolute path in the CSS @font-face declaration.Unicode subsetting: embed only the glyphs used in the document (subsetting) to keep PDF file sizes manageable — WeasyPrint handles this automatically; Puppeteer requires a subsetting pre-processing step.Line height: Tamil and Devanagari scripts require more vertical space than Latin — set line-height: 1.8 minimum for paragraphs containing Indian script text.Text alignment: Tamil and Hindi body text should use text-align: justify with word-break: normal (Tamil) and overflow-wrap: break-word (Hindi) for clean paragraph rendering.Testing: maintain a test suite of PDF generation for all three languages — generate a sample of each document type (letter, return, magazine page) in all three languages and verify visually after any template or font change.7.3  Machine Translation IntegrationRecommended API: Google Cloud Translation v3 (supports Tamil and Hindi at high quality) or IndicTrans2 (open-source, self-hostable, purpose-built for Indian languages — preferred for data privacy in banking context).IndicTrans2 supports English → Tamil and English → Hindi translation with high accuracy for formal, domain-specific banking text. Self-hosting on the portal's backend server is recommended to avoid sending internal banking content to third-party APIs.Machine translation is used only as a draft assist in the Admin content entry UI — it is never used to auto-publish content without human review.Translation API calls are rate-limited and logged to prevent misuse.8.  Quality Assurance Checklist — Photo & Trilingual8.1  Portrait PhotoUpload a valid JPEG — verify thumbnail, standard, and high-res versions generated correctly.Upload an image below minimum resolution — verify rejection with appropriate error message in user's language.Upload without a face — verify soft warning displayed but upload not blocked.Verify photo appears in: profile page, org chart (internal), org chart (public portal), contact directory, generated PDF letter signature block.Verify photo does not appear in public portal before Admin approval.Trigger a user transfer — verify posting history record stores photo reference from before the transfer.Bulk upload ZIP — verify matching by Employee ID and mismatch flagging.8.2  Trilingual InterfaceSwitch language toggle on public portal — verify all static content switches immediately.Switch language in user profile — log out, log back in — verify language preference persists.Create a Notice in all three languages — verify each user role sees the notice in their preferred language.Generate an Appreciation Letter in Tamil — verify PDF renders Tamil text correctly with Noto Sans Tamil font.Generate the same letter in Hindi — verify Devanagari renders correctly.Generate 'All Three' option — verify three-section PDF with correct fonts and language headers.Send an in-app notification to a Hindi-preference user — verify notification text is in Hindi.Verify MIS snapshot parameter labels switch language with the toggle.Verify status badges (SURPASSED / POSITIVE / LAGGING / NEGATIVE) appear in the correct language.Create a Notice with only English — verify Tamil/Hindi-preference users see the English fallback with 'Translation pending' indicator.Verify monthly magazine generates three separate language editions.Verify all master data (branch names, designation titles, department names) appear in correct language across all screens.End of Addendum — Portrait Photo & Trilingual SpecificationThis addendum must be read together with the Bank Regional Office Portal Build Prompt and the MIS / Business Snapshot Specification. The portrait photo and trilingual requirements described herein are cross-cutting — they affect every module in the system. Development teams should ensure these requirements are addressed in the architectural design phase before any module-level implementation begins.
